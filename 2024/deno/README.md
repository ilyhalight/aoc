## How to run

Replace <number> with number of day, e.g. day1

1. Install [Deno](https://deno.com)
2. Write your input to `day<number>/input.txt` (without ending with new line). If you want to check sample data, don't create input.txt
3. Run in terminal (some days has only parted filename, e.g. part1.ts and part2.ts):

```bash
deno task day<number>
```

```bash
deno run --allow-read day<number>/index.ts
```
