## How to run

Replace <number> with number of day, e.g. day1

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
2. Write your input to `day<number>/input.txt` (without ending with new line). If you want to check sample data, don't create input.txt
3. Run in terminal (some days has only parted filename, e.g. part1.rs and part2.rs):

```bash
cargo run --manifest-path=day<number>/Cargo.toml
```
